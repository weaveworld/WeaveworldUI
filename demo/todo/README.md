| _framework_  | _(files)_ | _(chars)_ 
| ------------- | --- | --- 
| Weaveworld  | 2 | ~ 1300 
| Vue  | 3 | ~ 1300  
| React  | 4 | ~ 2824 
| Angular |8| ~ 3100

(Weaveworld needs only basic HTML/JS knowledge and a browser.)

In case of full-scale business web applications, the code based on Weaveworld is about 2-4 times smaller and simpler than the usual methods.

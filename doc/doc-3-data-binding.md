# WeaveworldUI - Data-binding #

Weaveworld has a two-way data binding in ECMAScript 6 environment, so changing fields of data (e.g., in event handler definitions) causes actualization of the corresponding HTML elements.

## 'Weaving' - w$weave ##

Actualization can be directly invoked (e.g., in ECMAScript 5 environment) via the `w$refresh('now',el)` call, where `el` is the element to be actualized. Calling only `w$refresh(el)` schedules actualizing the element, and all the scheduled actualization will automatically performed in a short period of time (~1/3 sec).

There is a `w$weave` utility function to make easier to change data. That is the so called "_weaving_". It has a base HTML _**element**_ (which has the current data or list of data-binding), has a **mode**, i.e., how to change current data or list, and may have the **data** for the change.

**"Weaving"** (`w$weave`) automatizes most of the typical data manipulations -looking for the HTML element's bound data or list, and making data manipulations-, what can be performed by a simple call.  
In case of weaving, _current data_ means the bound data to the _el_ HTML element (or the first outer HTML element which has bound data). And _outer list_ means the list data of the first outer HTML element which has bound _list_ data.

```js
W$TYPE={ $name:'Order',
};
W$TYPE={ $name:'Item',
  addItem$arg:"order:Order\\order_id",
  addItem: function(el,ev,arg){
    weave(el,']',arg); // add to the end of the outer list
  },
  removeItem$arg:"id",
  removeItem: function(el,ev,arg){
    weave(el,'-'); // remove from the outer list
  },
};
```

`w$weave`(_el_  <sub>[</sub>,_mode_ <sub>[</sub>,_object_<sub>]</sub><sub>]</sub>):
* _el_: the element as the 'basis' for data change. (Using _weaving_ in an event handler definition, that is mostly the first (element) argument of the event-handler "rule".) 
* _mode_: an optional _prefix_ and a _code_, what specifies the change
  * The mode may have a _prefix_
    * '~': _**no**_ clearing of warnings and no `w$refresh`
    * '!': _**forced**_ clearing of warnings and `w$refresh`
    * if there's no prefix, then the `true` or `false` value of the `WEAVEWORLD.W$REFRESH` determines, if the '!' (in case of `true`) or the '~' (in case of `false`) is considered as default. Currently, it is set to `true` (set to "forced").
  * The _code_ can be
    * '' (i.e., empty string) - it **merges** the fields of the _object_ into the current value.
    * '[' - adds the _object_ at the **beginning** of the outer list.
    * ']' - adds the _object_ at the **end** of the outer list.
    * '<' - inserts the _object_ into the outer list **before** the current data.
    * '>' - nserts the _object_ into the outer list **after** the current data.
    * '-' - **deletes** the current data from the outer list.
    * '.' - **replaces** the current data with the _object_ in the outer list.
    * '#' - **replaces the list** with the _object_ (what has to be an array).
    * '=' - **replaces the current data** with the _object_; it _does perform_ a w$refresh.
    * '?' - only loads **warnings**; it _does not perform_ w$refresh.
* _object_: the (modification) data.

The steps of `w$weave`:
1. Firstly, it may clear warnings for the data (namely, all the fields which ends with '$warning' is set to `undefined`).
2. It changes the current data.
3. It sets warning fields (for all the _w_ prefixed fields of the change, the '$warning' postfixed field is set).
4. It may perform a `w$refresh` on the element.

## Server call ##

It is suggested to define a function to perform server (AJAX) calls, or redefine `W$CALL`. (The `w$ajax` utility function can be used as helper. `W$CALL` sets the `Pragma: W$CALL` header by default, so servere can identify these requests.)

Currently, `W$CALL` is defined to be fit to REST APIs and "ONCE-style" server calls (ONCE is the server side part of the Weaveworld-ONCE environment).

`W$CALL`(<sub>[</sub>_cmd_<sub>]</sub> <sub>[</sub>,_arg_<sub>]</sub>
     <sub>[</sub>,_element_ <sub>[</sub>,_weaving_mode_ <sub>[</sub>,_weaving_data_<sub>]]]</sub>)
*  _cmd_ has two formats based on that if there is or isn't a colon inside the _cmd_:
    * _METHOD_<sub>[</sub>.json<sub>]</sub>:<sub>[</sub>_URL_<sub>]</sub> – This format is mainly used for REST API.
      * Performs an AJAX call via _METHOD_. Using the `.json` postfix, arguments are sent as JSON (instead of `application/x-www-form-urlencoded`)
      * Usually _URL_ is relative to the [base URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base).
      * E.g., `W$CALL('GET:task',el)`
      * E.g., `W$CALL('DELETE:task/'+this.id,el,'-')`
      * E.g., `W$CALL('POST:task/'+this.id,arg,el)`
      * E.g., `W$CALL('POST.json:task/'+this.id,arg,el)`
    * the **name** of the server function to be called – this is a POST request for the [base URL](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/base) with JSON arguments. 
      * (In case of "ONCE-style" AJAX calls)   
* _arg_: arguments of the call
* (One of the _cmd_ or _arg_ is required. Both of them can be given.)
* _element_: the base element for weaving
* _weaving_mode_: the weave mode; if it is not specified but the _element_ is, the default mode is '' (i.e., merge).
* _weaving_data_: this argument overrides the data to be weaved. The default data to be weaved is the result of the server call.

`W$CALL`(_cmd_ <sub>[</sub>,_arg_<sub>]</sub>, _function_): an alternate form with a callback function.

```js
W$TYPE={ $name:'Order',
};
W$TYPE={ $name:'Item',
  addItem$arg:"order:Order\\order_id",
  addItem: function(el,ev,arg){
    W$CALL('addItem',arg,el,'.'); 
    // the newly created item in the response replaces the current one
  },
  setItem$arg:"id",
  setItem: function(el,ev,arg){
    W$CALL('setItem',arg,el); // (default weaving) merge and warnings
  },
  removeItem$arg:"id",
  removeItem: function(el,ev,arg){
    if(arg.id) W$CALL('removeItem',arg, el,'-'); // remove
  },
};
```

**_Note_**: Using ONCE-style server parameters, the operation name is given by a property, which name starts with an '`!`' (exclamation mark). Usually values of the "operation name" properties are not processed, so they can contain anything. This method has several advantages:
* Operation name and all the arguments can be given as a single JSON object.
```js
W$TYPE={ $name:"Task", 
  DELETED: 0, 
  ACTIVE: 1, 
  STARTED: 2, 
  COMPLETED:3,
  taskAdd: function(el,ev,arg){
    W$CALL({'!taskAdd':'', name:arg.name, state:this.ACTIVE }, el, ']')
  },
  taskStarted: function(el,ev,arg){
    W$CALL({'!taskSet':'', id:this.id, state:this.STARTED }, el)
  },
  taskCompleted: function(el,ev,arg){
    W$CALL({'!taskSet':'', id:this.id, state:this.COMPLETED }, el)
  },  
  ...
```
* The name attributes of HTML `<button` ...`>` and `<input type="`_submit_|_button_|...`"` ...`>` elements can refer to the operation name (started by '`!`').
```html
<form ...>
  <button type=submit name="!taskSet">Save</button>
  <button type=button name="!taskUnset">Delete</button>
  <button type=reset >Reset</button>
</form>
```

* The server (like ONCE or the [Weaveworld Node.js module](https://github.com/weaveworld/weaveworld-app)) can provide accessing its operations using GET requests (only in development mode). This way, operations can easily be tested.
  * E.g., `http://localhost:3000/?!taskGet&id=1`
  * E.g., `http://localhost:3000/?!taskAdd&name=Task_1&state=1`
  * E.g., `http://localhost:3000/?!taskSet&id=1&state=3`

**_Note_**: To use other server call methods (e.g., to access old [JSON-RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-RPC)), the `W$CALL` can be redefined.

## Initial data ##

The actual way to get **initial data** is determined by the `W$DATA` and the `W$START` variables.

* **No data**: that means `W$DATA` and `W$START` are both **undefined** (this is the default).
  * This case means no template actualization. This way the page can be viewed (and UX designed) in its raw form, containing only example data.
* **Server data**: `W$START` is a **string** and `W$DATA` can be given.
  * In this case `W$CALL` is called with the `W$START` parameter and `W$DATA` arguments and the result is used for data-binding.
  * E.g., `W$START="GET:/task";`
  * E.g., `W$START="GET:/qr"; W$DATA=w$getParameters();` // using (https) GET parameters 
  * E.g., `W$START="POST:/q"; W$DATA=w$getParameters({extended:1});` // using the (https) GET parameters of the page with defaults and send as a POST request
* **Inline data**: `W$DATA` is **defined** and `W$START` can be a function, and then it is called with the W$DATA argument, so its result will be used for data-binding.
  * This method is used, when the server modifies the page using some results of server and data is put directly into the page as a JavaScript assignment. (This can be used when HTML pages are targeted with POST requests.) 
  * This method can also be used for example or constant data, so with these settings the standalone pages can be UX designed (without the server's service functions).
* **Parameters** as data: `W$DATA` is **undefined**, but `W$START` is a **function**, which is called with the (GET) parameters as arguments.
  * This is used, when the page can start itself with the optional (GET) parameters.
  
## Initializing ##

The initializer steps are the followings:
* Firstly, Weaveworld converts the page into an effective **template** format. In the meantime,
  * The content of `<!--!w:css!  -->` comments are added as CSS rules.
  * The content of `<!--!w:script!  -->` comments are added as JavaScript fragments.
  * (These comments are subjects of direct localization.  
  In production mode, a filter can transform the HTML into effective and localized HTML/JS/CSS files.)
* Weaveworld determines the **initial data**, based on the W$DATA and W$START.
* If there are some data, so W$DATA and W$START are not both undefined, then
  * The page as template is **actualized** based on the current data.
  * The functions of the `W$ONLOAD` array are called. (Functions can be put into the W$ONLOAD which should run after the actualization.)
  * If the `W$SYNC` is defined as a function, it is called. (It can be used for asynchron update calls.)

```js
W$ONLOAD.push(function(){ // append after the end
  console.log('The page is actualized...'); 
})
W$ONLOAD.unshift(function(){ // insert before the beginning 
  console.log('First of all...'); 
})
```
